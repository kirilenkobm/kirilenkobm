# Hi, I'm Bogdan Kirilenko ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent developer with a strong foundation in bioinformatics, having experience in both industry and academia. My work has encompassed a broad range of areas, including comparative genomics and the development of data pipelines. In addition to my bioinformatics work, I've recently ventured into iOS development. I also have a passion for exploring the intersection of coding and art, constantly seeking innovative ways to blend these two fields.

## ðŸš€ My Projects

While my contributions are not limited to these, I'd like to highlight two projects that I'm particularly proud of:

### ðŸ§¬ TOGA
I'm the creator of [TOGA](https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA), a bioinformatics tool that integrates gene annotation with orthology inference at scale. You can read more about it in this [Science publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10193443/).

### ðŸ“± Papper
I'm also a developer of the Papper iOS app. Papper is currently in open beta, and you can download it [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1EsWRgz7). For more information, visit the [Papper website](https://papper.co).
